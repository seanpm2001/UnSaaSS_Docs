# UnSaaSS Documentation

## Etymology

### UnSaaS

UnSaaS stands for `Undo Software as a Service` it is the incorrect term for the movement of moving away/making alternatives for [`SaaSS`](/Docs/Etymology/SaaSS/) and making the world less reliant on quickly disposable software and hardware. It is an unwanted variant which doesn't emphasize that SaaSS is a service **substitute**

The word `UnSaaS` should be avoided, and `UnSaaSS` should be used instead.
