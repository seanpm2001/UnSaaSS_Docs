# UnSaaSS Documentation

## Etymology

### UnSaaSS

UnSaaSS stands for `Undo Software as a Service Substitute` it is a term for a movement of moving away/making alternatives for [`SaaSS`](/Docs/Etymology/SaaSS/) and making the world less reliant on quickly disposable software and hardware. It has an unwanted variant [`UnSaaS`](/Docs/Etymology/UnSaaS/) (`Undo Software as a Service`) which doesn't emphasize that SaaSS is a service **substitute**

The word `UnSaaS` should be avoided, and `UnSaaSS` should be used instead.
